All that is required for coding is a text editor and some form of a compiler/kernel to run the code. Back in the day, most folks used VIM/EMACS (VIM being superior) to edit their code and compiled/ran that code in terminal. This creates a lot of moving parts, and why most people use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). VSCode is one of the most up to date IDEs available on Biowulf, and includes a great amount of optionality including:

- Library of extensions for visualization, compiling, interactivity, etc.
- Create and open a vast number of file types, with on-the-fly syntax linting
- Folder navigator, terminal, GitHub tracking built in
- Access to a HPC resources (on Biowulf)
