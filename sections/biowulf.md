# Biowulf

## Background
<p>
Biowulf is the high-performance computation (HPC) cluster at the NIH. Most questions one can have about using Biowulf are answered in their [user guides](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/user_guides.html). This guide assumes one has never used Biowulf before and serves as the starting point, which the rest of the guide will consist of working on Biowulf using a NIH computer. As Biowulf is a linux system running [slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/documentation.html) job management, parts will be applicable to other institution level HPCs.
